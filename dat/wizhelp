New commands in debug mode:

Note that these commands are accessible only via #repeat (#), which allows
arbitrary commands to be entered.  Note also that careless use of debug mode
features can easily crash the game; debug-mode bugs are low priority, and the
amount of power that debug mode gives you includes the ability to do things
that are impossible in normal play, and that the game does not allow for.  (In
fact, at least one of the commands is designed to crash the game.)

#detect           Detect secret doors and traps
#genesis          Create a monster
#identify         Identify your inventory
#levelchange      Change your experience level
#lightsources     Show mobile light sources
#map              Magic-map the current level
#monpolycontrol   Control what polymorphing monsters polymorph into
#panic            Test panic routines, crashing the game in the process
#polyself         Polymorph the player character
#seenv            Show seen vectors
#stats            Show memory statistics
#timeout          Show timeout queue
#vision           Show vision array
#where            Show the dungeon layout
#wish             Create an item
#wmode            Show wall modes

Additionally, for historical reasons, #tutorial allows you to level-teleport
while in debug mode (they used to have the same keybinding, control-V).

Also note that many other commands are enhanced to give you extra power in
debug mode, notably control-X.
