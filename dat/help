AceHack is a Dungeons and Dragons like game where you (the adventurer) descend
into the depths of the dungeon in search of the Amulet of Yendor, reputed to
be hidden somewhere below the twentieth level.  You begin your adventure with
a pet that can help you in many ways, and can be trained to do all sorts of
things.  On the way you will find useful (or useless) items, quite possibly
with magic properties, and assorted monsters.  You can attack a monster by
trying to move onto the space a monster is on (but often it is much wiser to
leave it alone).  Unlike text adventure games, which give you a verbal
description of your location, AceHack gives you a visual image of the dungeon
level you are on, showing terrain and items with punctuation marks, and
monsters (usually) as letters.  To determine what a symbol means, use the ;
command to view what's on a square on the map, or the / command to explain a
symbol typed in.

In addition to the commands shown in the quick reference above, a range of
other commands exist in order to make playing the game faster, or allow for
various more bizarre actions (see ?b for a complete list):
