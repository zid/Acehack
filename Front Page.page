**AceHack** is a variant of the computer game [NetHack](http://nethack.org), aimed to keep similar (although not necessarily identical) gameplay to the original game, while improving its interface.

This wiki also contains information relevant to the development of AceHack:

- The [TODO]() page lists things that will likely be in AceHack eventually;
- The [Ideas]() page contains ideas for future changes;
- The [Bugs]() page contains bugs in AceHack that should ideally be fixed (many of which are also in NetHack).

As AceHack's gameplay is so similar to NetHack's, if you're looking for, or want to add, gameplay advice about AceHack, a good place is  the [NetHack Wiki](http://nethackwiki.com). Most of the information there will also apply to AceHack, and AceHack-specific information will likely be welcomed if its context is made clear.
