Changes in AceHack 3.6.0.  Emacs, this is a -*- text -*- file.

This is a list of changes between NetHack 3.4.3 and AceHack 3.6.0.
These are in no particular order, and every change is listed, even
though some are likely much bigger than others. Changes here that are
not credited use code specific to AceHack, and were likely made by
Alex Smith.

General Fixes
-------------

Reading a cursed scroll of destroy armor no longer gives permanent
increases to abilities while wearing cursed gauntlets of dexterity or
a cursed helm of brilliance.

It's no longer possible to wrest a wand in one turn via levitation.
(Patch credits: Brent Dalager <bcd@pvv.org>)

Item lists are now sorted into alphabetical order; this avoids an
exploit whereby the player could determine the identity of an item
from the order it appeared in a bones file.  (Patch credits: Jeroen
Demeyer and Jukka Lahtinen, via Debian.)

The "Itemized billing?" prompt now supports 'q' as an option.

All items in a character's starting inventory are now marked as
prerecognised.  (It's assumed that characters got the chance to take
them into the dungeon well in advance, rather than finding out just as
they entered.)

High Priests on the Astral Plane no longer give away their identity
when Called something else.

Candles can now be added to a candelabrum while underwater.  (Patch
credits: Sgeo via the NetHack patchdb)

Bisecting a long worm with 1hp no longer crashes the game.  (Patch
credits: bhaak via the NetHack patchdb)

The game no longer crashes if a thrown potion breaks on iron bars and
would otherwise have hit a monster.  (Patch credits: bhaak via
UnNetHack.)

The game no longer crashes when a wielded item is applied to the face,
autotransforms, or burns out.  (Patch credits: bhaak via UnNetHack.)

The game no longer crashes when a wielded potion of polymorph is drunk
and polymorphs the player into a monster with no hands.

The game no longer crashes when acid falls into a pool or moat.
(Patch credits: bhaak via UnNetHack.)

Some typographical and grammatical errors were fixed.  (Patch credits:
bhaak via UnNetHack for some fixes, others are original to AceHack.)

Many messages have been corrected to be more accurate; YAFMs have been
added in certain special cases where a generic message wouldn't make
much sense. Likewise, there are also some extra hallucination messages.

Some actions now take 1 action rather than 0: manipulating a
drawbridge with music, kicking at nothing.  (Patch credits: bhaak via
UnNetHack.)

The game no longer crashes when trying to travel on a level with a
very large number of boulders or with certain highly unusual
placements of closed doors.

The materials and/or descriptions of some objects have been changed to
make them react more consistently with what their names suggest (pearl
rings are now made of bone; leather spellbooks are now "leather-bound"
to signify they're really made of paper).

Wielded silver arrows now deal silver damage the same way wielded
silver nonweapons do. (Even though bashing with arrows isn't
particularly affective, the silver is enough to hurt certain
monsters no matter how clumsily it makes contact.)

Boulders generated via polymorph now block line of sight correctly.

The game no longer goes into an infinite loop upon an input error at a
--More-- prompt.  (Patch credits: from SporkHack, via UnNetHack.)

The game will now try to recover from some sorts of trickery.

Modified Features
-----------------

Scoring has been completely redone; players are now scored in a number
of categories, with huge diminishing returns in each category.  Thus,
it's better to do well in a range of things than very well in one;
hopefully, this will put a stop to score being meaningless (or worse,
a low score being considered more impressive than a high one).

The AI for pets has been improved, meaning that intelligent pets are
now capable of actually using many of their attacks.  (Patch credits:
code by Grunt)

Most of the options in the game have been removed or hidden; they
still exist if anyone really wants to change them, but most of them
have been set to sane defaults and then made undocumented.  Even some
of the ones that still exist have changed defaults (e.g. color to
true, autopickup [and exceptions to it] to a sane set of settings).

runmode, timed_delay, and sparkle are now one combined option,
"animation".  If you have a fast computer, it's likely that the only
settings for it that actually show visible animation are "timed" and
"nosparkle"; the other settings are provided for slower machines.

The control-X feature now shows a lot more information, including
things like the player's intrinsics; none of the information there is
anything that a spoilt player couldn't work out from their own message
history, but actually doing so was often a pain, and required perusing
a recording of the game or a good memory.

It's now possible to read spellbooks of spells you know quite well
already; doing so refreshes your knowledge, but wears out the
spellbook just as much as rememorising a spell or refreshing an almost
forgotten spell.  The game also lists how much memory you have of a
spell in the + and Z menus.

The entrances to all branches and the dlvl 1 upstairs are now ladders,
rather than stairs; additionally, stairs in the Mines have become
ladders.  This is both for flavour, and to help the player distinguish
normal stairs from branch entrances.

The Vibrating Square is now visible from a distance; it will always be
marked if it's ever been in the player's LOS and is not covered by a
monster or object, due to it now giving off a visible glow.

The game's command system has been rewritten, making commands
customizable.  The major breaking changes are: "repeat command" is now
on # rather than n or digits (extended commands are /still/ on #, but
no clash is possible); and by default, digits have their numpad
meaning, and letters have their vikeys meaning (so even if you use the
numpad to move, you'll need to use ^D or #kick to kick).  All commands
are now available as extended commands; and likewise, all
(non-wizmode) commands but "enter explore mode" are now available as
non-extended commands, either by adding new commands or generalising
old ones.  (A specific list of what has changed command-wise, and how
to customize commands, is given in the "Change Detail" section at the
end.)

Many monsters have changed colour (ghosts and shades have even changed
sym, to W) in order to make it easier for the player to tell them
apart; underlining is used as well as colour for this purpose.  (See
the "Change Detail" section at the end for details.)

Jumping boots now give a message when worn or removed (in nearly every
case in vanilla NetHack, you can check /anyway/ without even spending
a turn), which causes them to self-ID.  Likewise, all characters
recognise potions of oil for the same reason.  (Credits: suggestion
for auto-IDing jumping boots by casmith789.)

The gaze of a floating eye now forces players to miss, rather than
paralyzing them.  (Floating eyes still have their paralysis defence in
all other contexts.)

Instead of automatically confirming attacks on peaceful monsters,
Stormbringer now acts as a ring of aggravate monster while wielded (in
addition to its other effects).

Amnesia's effect has been changed.  It now no longer causes the player
to forget the map or seen traps; instead, it affects a much larger
proportion of objects.  Forgotten objects are now /called/ by their
actual name; so forgetting what a potion of blindness does, for
instance, would lead to "potion called potion of blindness" rather
than "potion of blindness" in the inventory.  It also causes the
player to forget skills, and drains some of the training towards those
skills.

Travel now handles traps more sensibly: it will go slightly out of its
way to avoid walking through a trap, but if it's necessary to go
through a trap, it will travel to just before the trap and then stop,
allowing the player to choose to walk through it or continue.
(Credits: Suggestion for the change by nht.)

It's no longer possible to fail to choose a direction for a spell;
NetHack 3.4.3 just repeats the last direction (perhaps killing the
player arbitrarily), AceHack 3.6.0 will keep prompting until a
direction is given. Similar fixes apply to all other direction
prompts, which will keep prompting repeatedly until explicitly
cancelled (as spellcasting always requires a direction, it'll keep
prompting until one is given even /if/ explicitly cancelled).
Targeting prompts are also a little more explicit in what input they
want now, too.

While not stunned, confused, levitating, flying, or in a monster form
that can move along the ceiling, attempting to move into known water
or lava now requires an 'm' prefix (or whatever it's set to in your
options), in order to prevent players falling into water or lava by
mistake.  (Credits: suggestion by casmith789.)

Attempting to walk into a door is now equivalent to trying to open it
(say with the 'o' command).  (This even works for an unknown door;
just leaning on a door is enough to open it, unless it gets stuck or
resists.)  (Credits: idea taken from UnNetHack, but with different
code.)

Walking into shopkeepers now attempts to pay them, if you owe them
anything; walking into other always-peaceful monsters (or shopkeepers
who you owe no money) chats to them.  (Sometimes-peaceful monsters
still give the "do you want to attack?" prompt.)  In order to attack
such monsters, use the 'F' command.

The #enhance/^E screen now shows how many skill slots you have left,
and how many it costs you to enhance various skills.

The message "You climb up the ladder." no longer appears when climbing
ladders (mostly because ladders are a lot more prevalent in AceHack
than in NetHack).

Timings for equipping and unequipping objects have changed slightly.
In particular, it now does not cost a turn to swap your main and
readied weapons (and as a result, it /does/ cost a turn to put a
weapon straight into your readied-weapon slot, using the A command.)

If the player cannot see themselves, they're shown as a remembered-
invisible I, rather than not shown at all; this makes it rather
easier to track the player's current location with certain sorts of
cursor.

While moving the cursor for a location prompt (such as when farlooking
or casting a location-targeted spell), farlook information is shown at
the top of the screen.

The player is now prompted upon attempting to eat something that the
character would know is dangerous even without magical aid (such as an
old or poisonous corpse).

Rubbing a lamp no longer requires wielding it.

Instead of using engravings of the word "Elbereth" to protect against
hostile monsters, instead a special engraving type, the "magic
heptagram", is provided, which does the same thing and has the same
properties, but is easier on the interface.  (To draw it, use E-h, or
simply press .).  Unlike writing Elbereth, heptagrams do not exercise
wisdom.

Dropping containers onto altars BCUs the items inside, if not blind
and not hallucinating.

Gnomes now have a chance of generating with candles, especially in the
Mines; this should help players recover from the accidental
destruction of their stash or an understocked Izchak's.  (This is
almost a bug in vanilla, as without spare wishes, there's pretty much
no way to recover from that situation without pudding farming or a lot
of luck.)

Picking up items warns whenever it would make your burden level
increase.

Cursed light-sources become marked as cursed when they fail to light
as a result. (Patch credits: patch by rawrmage).

The "Things that are here:" list now shows only if blind (or if
there's only one item, when it's just an ordinary message rather than
an item).  When blind, it shows no matter how many objects there are,
as it would otherwise take a turn to determine what they were, even
though the character knows.

Objects that spawn in fixed locations on the map are now preidentified
(to be precise, identify themselves as soon as you interact with them,
or look at or farlook them).  There have been minor changes to some
maps to prevent this leaking information (specifically, the treasure
room in the Gnome King's Wine Cellar ending).

The player now gets a warning before trying to nest bags of holding
(with an override, so that trying to nest them with sacks in between
is still possible).  Trying to place a bag of tricks or wand of
cancellation in a bag of holding gives no warning (to prevent them
being IDed that way), but is no longer as catastrophically bad as it
was in vanilla NetHack; the item that would destroy the bag is instead
drained of all charges.

Platform- and/or Interface-Specific Fixes
-----------------------------------------

(tty interface)
The botl has been cleaned up significantly, leaving a lot more room to
show things like statuses.  It also now shows semi-graphical Hp and Pw
bars that change colour according to how wounded or exhausted you are.
Statuses are now coloured according to severity, and many more things
are shown as statuses than were before (e.g. levitation, greasy hands,
poisoned).  (Credits: Thanks to Squolly for suggesting the expansion
of statuses.)

New centralised routines are used for drawing things to the screen;
although potentially slightly less efficient than the old ones,
they make it much easier to extend the drawing code to do new sorts of
drawing.  They also now set both the foreground and background colors
explicitly if the color option is turned on; this should avoid the
problem where graphics can't be seen properly due to unusual terminal
settings such as a white background.

The default character used to represent web traps is now ^ rather than
".

(tty interface on all platforms but DOS, OS/2, WIN32)
IBMgraphics now sends signals to the terminal telling it to select a
suitable character set for drawing that graphics; hopefully, this will
make IBMgraphics "just work" rather than requiring crazy character set
fixes.  The control codes \001 and \004 are no longer used on the
Rogue level on these platforms either, preventing many terminals
breaking upon encountering it.

(UNIX-like systems, either directly or via autoconf)
The default number of players allowed to play at once on a UNIX system
is now unlimited, rather than 4.  (The restriction is a pretty
meaningless one anyway, as it can be avoided merely by running NetHack
directly rather than via the script that normally runs it.)

(64-bit systems)
The source has been adjusted to compile safely on 64-bit systems.
(Patch credits: Clive Crous, via UnNetHack.)

General New Features
--------------------

A new tutorial mode provides hints on the game and its controls as
it's played.

A new "solo mode" lets the player play without interference from other
player's games (although mail can still be sent unless that is also
disabled in the options), meaning that bones files are not loaded
(although can still be left). It also prevents viewing a character's
stats before play starts, meaning that startscumming will be visible
in the logfile.

The menucolors patch has been added, allowing customisable colouring
of menus based on regular expressions.  (Patch credits: Pasi Kallinnen
via UnNethack.)  AceHack-specific additions include a default set of
colours for items depending on the item's behavior: see "Change
Detail" for more information.

Every area of the game now has coloured walls and floor.  The exact
colours depend on which branch you're in, whether you've stepped on
the square before, and whether it's lit; dark areas of a room are now
shown coloured rather than as blank space (unless color is turned
off).  (Patch credits: based on the darkroom patch by Clive Crous, via
UnNetHack.) An option "floorcolor" controls complex floor coloring;
turning it off leaves the floor as just white or blue (corresponding
to the white and black in vanilla NetHack).

Objects in shops now have visible price tags, that are shown when you
step on them.  (Patch credits: a marginally modified version of a
patch by bhaak for UnNetHack.) Additionally, objects with unique
price/weight combinations within their object class (such as scrolls
of identify and tooled horns) will be pre-identified if found in a
shop, except for weapons, armour, and rocks/gems.

New commands ^O (or #overview) and ^F (or #annotate) show a summary of
features you've seen on levels you've visited, and allow you to name
the current dungeon level with a name that shows up in ^O,
respectively.  (Patch credits: Hojita Discordia, via UnNetHack.)

A Crawl-style autoexplore feature has been added; pressing v will
repeatedly travel to the nearest unexplored square (a square which
will give more information about the map or a stack of items).
However, NetHack is not nearly as suited to autoexplore as Crawl is; I
find that using the command leads to exploration considerably less
efficient than I could manage by hand, and so I must caution people to
use this at their own risk. Autoexplore stops upon encountering an
item, upon exploring into a dead end or next to a boulder (situations
which the player will likely want to handle themselves), upon
encountering a door for the first time, or upon failing to displace a
pet or open a door (although continuing autoexplore after failing to
open a locked door will ignore the door).  (Patch credits: mostly by
me, but with some contributions by bhaak.)

The set of things that stop travel and/or command repeat by default
has changed. In particular, pets will now be displaced rather than
stopping travel, and taking damage for any reason will stop command
repeat and travel.

Inventory lists now show the weight of each item in them, with a
couple of exceptions (specifically, items that the character couldn't
safely pick up to determine their weight, like unidentified gray
stones and cockatrice corpses). The weight of gauntlets of power was
changed to 10 to prevent this leaking information that isn't readily
available in vanilla NetHack. (Credits: this feature was inspired by
Vulture, although AceHack uses different code.)

Formally identifying light sources, or seeing them flicker, now makes
their remaining burn time visible (much like charges on formally
identified wands). Likewise, attempting to zap an empty wand marks it
as empty, and scrolls of charging also identify the number of charges
in the thing they charge (as a side-effect).

Autopickup now picks up thrown items by default (controllable via
option), even if they aren't of a type that would normally be picked
up.  (Patch credits: Roderick Schertler, via UnNetHack.)

Dumplogs are saved in a directory, allowing players to review the ends
of their previous games.

An extended logfile "xlogfile" provides more machine-readable
information about what happened in a game. (Credits: based on a patch
by Aardvark Joe, via UnNetHack.)

Platform- and/or Interface-Specific New Features
------------------------------------------------

(autoconf system)
The standard build system is now autoconf-based.  (Patch credits:
initially from Slash'EM; ported from UnNetHack)

(tty interface)
Monsters now have their background color changed to show various
aspects of the monster (blue=tame, brown=peaceful, magenta=detected).

There is a new character creation screen, that allows you to view a
character's stats and inventory before you start playing, and to
choose a different one if you don't like it.  (If you don't want to
startscum, and want to prove you didn't, play in solo mode.)

In addition to the new character creation screen, a new main menu
allows selection of the game mode (explore / debug / normal / tutorial
/ solo), and viewing the high-score table and help, and changing
options, without having to start a game.

The game now highlights possible directions to, e.g., fire things in,
by using a red background, if the "targethighlight" option (off by
default) is turned on in your options file.  (Credits: this was
kerio's idea.)

Background colors are also used to signify other things, e.g. detected
monsters, pets, peaceful monsters.  (Credits: This idea was inspired
by Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup.) Likewise, squares which contain known
traps are shown with a cyan background no matter what is actually on
the square, to warn the player against stumbling into them, and
squares containing known stairs, ladders, and portals are shown with a
white background no matter what is actually on the square, so they are
visible even with an item beneath them.

The character memorises whether doors are locked or unlocked, and this
is shown by changing their color (red for locked, green for unlocked,
the usual brown for unsure).

The last message shown is now always shown at the top of the screen in
dark blue, to make it easier to figure out what just happened when
moving quickly. (Control-P still works for reviewing messages, if you
want to check further back.)

Change Detail
-------------

Default menucolors for items (with some examples):
known cursed: orange
unidentified: cyan
enchantment+erosion negative: red
attack (e.g. weapons/attack wands/books of attack spells): green
item/dungeon-affecting (e.g. digging, enchanting, polymorph): brown
creation (e.g. create monster, bag of tricks, wishing): light cyan
intrinsics/extrinsics (e.g. invisibility, gain strength): light blue
debuffing enemies (e.g. sleep, taming, conflict): blue
divination (e.g. lamp, identify, crystal ball): white
healing (e.g. unihorn, potion of gain energy): yellow
movement (e.g. teleport, levitation, jumping): light green
harmful items (e.g. sickness, blindness, fumbling): magenta
mundane items (e.g. food ration, blank paper, fruit juice): gray
unique items (e.g. bell of opening, amulet of yendor): light magenta

Command changes:

1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,y,u,h,j,k,l,b,n: Numbers now have numpad meanings by
default, letters now have vikeys meanings by default.  So either the
numpad or the letter keys can be used to move. For command repeat,
type # before the repeat count.
a: No longer breaks wands (use V).  Use a, to loot containers on the
ground.  a can also be used to dip into potions.  (Credits: The use of
, this way was inspired by Slash'EM, although the code is
mine. Certain other commands have the same change, using , to indicate
floor items.)
A: Now allows equipping items to arbitrary slots, as well as
unequipping them from those slots.
c, #chat: c now means #chat (the old meaning of c, "close door", has
been moved to o).  These commands can now be used to pay your bill in
a shop (which takes precedence over ordinary chatting).
C, #name: These commands have been merged, and display a menu to ask
what to do.  (Credits: nethack.alt.org for the idea, although the code
is mine.)  They also allow naming of recently destroyed items (so that
players aren't prompted in the middle of something else to name them),
and calling items by appearance,
e: Allows , as an argument to eat from the floor.
E: Allows drawing heptagrams as well as text.
^E: Now a synonym for #enhance.
G: A combined command for controlled teleportation, jumping, and
riding. (They're all forms of jump, if you think about it.)
I: Now also describes items if they are selected from the list shown,
in addition to just listing parts of the inventory.
^I: Now a synonym for #adjust.
M: Now a synonym for #monster.
o: Now both opens and closes doors; and unlocks known locked doors
with the most recently used unlocking tool in inventory.
q: Allows , as an argument, to drink from sinks/fountains.
Q: No longer prints a message about #quit.
s: No longer wakes mimics (instead, upon detecting a mimic, an
unseen-monster I glyph is placed on the square to mark its location).
S: Now allows the user to quit, in addition to continuing to play.
(The key sequence S!y to quit is chosen to be almost impossible to
press by mistake, in order to hopefully prevent accidents; I had
trouble typing it in order to write this changelog!)
T, R: These commands have been merged; either will allow armor or
accessories to be removed, with R now being deprecated.
v: Now does autoexplore. (The old v was moved to #versionshort, or the
? menu.)
V: A new command that merges #rub, #invoke, and wand-breaking; it can
also be used to ignite a potion of oil (as a would mean dipping into
the potion of oil).  (The old V was moved to #versionhistory, or the ?
menu.)
^V: New command, to review tutorial slides.
W, P: These commands have been merged; either will allow armor or
accessories to be worn, with P now being deprecated.
^W: Shows a menu, allowing #offer, #pray, or #turn.
x: No longer costs a turn.
X: Now a synonym for #twoweapon.  (Credits: Another nethack.alt.org
idea.)  The old meaning of X, "enter explore mode", was moved to
#xplore.
^X: Now shows ability scores (as they're no longer on the botl), both
current and "natural" (i.e. without the effects of items or poison);
some messages have been changed to allow for this (e.g. eating giants
now produces a message rather than increasing strength silently, a
patch by rawrmage). Additionally, it shows a count of your total
inventory weight, together with the nearest encumberance breakpoint.
Also lists information shown at game end, like inventory and conducts,
although it does not identify your possessions for you; likewise, it
will show your intrinsics, but not your extrinsics.
?: Now does what v used to do, and also lets you review tutorial
slides (redundantly with ^V).
#: Now used to repeat commands (like the old numpad n), in addition to
its use for entering extended commands.
^: Now shows a menu of trappable objects, and both lets you know which
traps you remember, and allows you to search for or disarm traps.
;: Describes items that are selected while farlooking (in addition to
the additional info while targeting mentioned earlier).
/: Now only describes strings typed in by the user (use ; to describe
something on the map).
>: Now interacts with any sort of terrain on the square, to go down or
up stairs, dip into fountains/water, sacrifice on altars, or sit on
other sorts of terrain.
.: Now draws a magic heptagram. (You can use s to wait one turn, or
#wait if you really need to wait one turn without searching.)

The following commands still have their old meanings, or are mapped to
a new command that encompasses their old meanings, but are now
deprecated in favour of other alternatives:
p (use c), P (use W), R (use T), * (use A).

(Credits for the idea of merging W/P and R/T go to dtsund.)

The following commands were deleted: !vV)[="(GM
v is now available as #versionshort (and V as #versionhistory);
something similar to ! should likely be provided by your operating
system (you can also use ^Z on systems that support it); and the
remaining equipment commands are all special cases of A. Instead of
using G or M, just use g, or control-letter or shift-letter if you
really need exactly the same functionality.

Command customization:

A new config file option REBIND= allows the rebinding of commands.
Each command in the game has a representation as an extended command
(e.g. the command bound to 'h' and '4' by default is called #west),
and you can choose which keys are bound to which commands (apart from
# itself, which is necessary so that it's always possible to, e.g.,
save or quit the game; however, you are allowed to bind additional
keys to #repeat). The syntax is to write REBIND=key:#command (with no
spaces), where the key in question is a single character, or ^
followed by a capital letter to represent control-letter, or M-
followed by an arbitrary character to represent combinations involving
the Meta modifier (which may not work on all keyboards). See qwertz.nh
in the doc/ folder for an example rebinding (that swaps z and y,
common for vi-keys play on German keyboards). You can also rebind a
key to #donothing to cause it to have no effect.
