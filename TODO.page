This is a mostly unsorted and vague list of changes which will probably eventually be in AceHack.

If you have ideas of your own, add them to the [Ideas]() page.

- default DEC/IBM/Unicode graphics
- calling wands just after engrave-IDing with them
- stash tracking
- some way to save notes with the character
- unequip one item to equip another
- uniqueness in trap colors
- cursed armor should autoBCU when worn
- ID kicking boots when they make things reel
- travel position should reset between levels
- new statuses need to cause a botl update
- applying keys should not ask so many questions
- travel should route past peacefuls more sensibly
- traps need a valid glyph in IBM rogue graphics
- lit middot vs. unlit lowdot; a consequence of darkroom vs. rogue? (it went away when I changed to IBM and back to DEC, so probably)
- option to stop autoexplore with unexplored objects in LOS
- show prices of items in containers
- wipe out engravings from the engrave menu
- price memory in \
- ^X going back to its own menu
- shift-walking into doors?
- name levels you aren't on
- second confirm on overwriting perm engraving with semiperm
- some way to mark squares on a level by hand
- extra question upon #loot/a,
